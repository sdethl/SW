### What is the difference between a stable and unstable sort?

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input unsorted array.

whereas a sorting algorithm is said to be unstable if their are two or more objects with equal keys doesnâ€™t appear in same order before and after sorting.

Some sorting algorithms such as Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc. are stable by nature And some sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc. are not stable by nature.
